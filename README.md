##Sensitivity Analysis Library (SALib)

Python implementations of commonly used sensitivity analysis methods. Useful in systems modeling to calculate the effects of model inputs or exogenous factors on outputs of interest. 

**Requirements:** [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/)

**Methods included:**
* Sobol Sensitivity Analysis ([Sobol 2001](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378475400002706), [Saltelli 2002](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465502002801), [Saltelli et al. 2010](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465509003087))
* Method of Morris ([Morris 1991](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00401706.1991.10484804), [Campolongo et al. 2007](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815206002805))

### Create a parameter file

To get started, create a file describing the sampling ranges for the parameters in the model. Parameter files should be created with 3 columns: `[name, lower bound, upper bound]`:
```
P1 0.0 1.0
P2 0.0 5.0
...etc.
```

#### Command-Line Interface
Lines beginning with `#` will be treated as comments and ignored.

### Generate samples

From the command line:
```
python -m SALib.sample.saltelli \
     -n 1000 \
     -p ./SALib/test_functions/params/Ishigami.txt \
     -o model_input.txt \
```

Other methods include `SALib.sample.morris_oat` and `SALib.sample.fast_sampler`. For an explanation of all command line options, [see the examples here](https://github.com/jdherman/SALib/tree/master/examples). 

Or, generate samples from Python:
```python
from SALib.sample import saltelli
import numpy as np

param_file = '../../SALib/test_functions/params/Ishigami.txt'
param_values = saltelli.sample(1000, param_file, calc_second_order = True)
np.savetxt('model_input.txt', param_values, delimiter=' ')
```

Either way, this will create a file of sampled input values in `model_input.txt`.

### Run model
Here's an example of running a test function in Python, but this will usually be a user-defined model, maybe even in another language. Just save the outputs.

```python
from SALib.test_functions import Ishigami
Y = Ishigami.evaluate(param_values)
np.savetxt('model_output.txt', Y, delimiter=' ')
```

### Analyze model output

From the command line:
```
python -m SALib.analyze.sobol \
     -p ./SALib/test_functions/params/Ishigami.txt \
     -Y model_output.txt \
     -c 0 \
```

This will print indices and confidence intervals to the command line. You can redirect to a file using the `>` operator.

Or, from Python:
```python
from SALib.analyze import sobol
import numpy as np
Si = sobol.analyze(param_file, 'model_output.txt', column = 0, print_to_console=False)
# Returns a dictionary with keys 'S1', 'S1_conf', 'ST', and 'ST_conf'
# e.g. Si['S1'] contains the first-order index for each parameter, in the same order as the parameter file
```
